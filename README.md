# Neighborhood Map Project


This is an app that helps you explore a small part of Manhattan, using Google Maps API & Foursquare API.

To load the site, either download or clone it from my github site [here.](https://ebbleberryjenny.github.com/neighborhood_map/) Then, load the *index.html* file in your favorite browser to start exploring.

## Enjoy!
